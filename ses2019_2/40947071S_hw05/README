「
	for CMake

	With CMake, cJSON supports a full blown build system. This way you get the most features. CMake with an equal or higher version than 2.8.5 is supported. With CMake it is recommended to do an out of tree build, meaning the compiled files are put in a directory separate from the source files. So in order to build cJSON with CMake on a Unix platform, make a build directory and run CMake inside it.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..

	This will create a Makefile and a bunch of other files. You can then compile it:

	make

	And install it with "make install"
